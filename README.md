```As a user,
When I visit "/"
And I fill in the search form with "sweet potatoes"
(Note: Use the existing search form)
And I click "Search"
Then I should be on page "/foods"
Then I should see a total of the number of items returned by the search.
(sweet potatoes should find more than 30,000 results)
Then I should see a list of TEN foods that contain the ingredient "sweet potatoes"

And for each of the foods I should see:
